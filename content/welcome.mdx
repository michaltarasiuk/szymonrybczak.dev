I'm very excited to finally launch my blog!

### Technology
I built this blog with the combination of following technologies:
- Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Database: [Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres)
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Content: [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/)
- Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

The combination of these tools leads to an awesome developer experience, while also ensuring a _really_ fast and optimized website.

I also used a few components from the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components library, which provides seamless integration, tidy and clean design that fits into the vibe of the whole website.

### Inspiration 
I envisioned this website to have a very minimalist design. I really love [Lee Robinson](https://twitter.com/leeerob)'s personal website - [leerob.io](https://leerob.io), which was a huge source of inspiration for me ‚ú® Likewise, [Pedro Duarte](https://twitter.com/peduarte)'s personal website - [ped.ro](https://ped.ro) has such fantastic vibes, and I borrowed a few ideas from there üôè

### Content
On this blog, I will try to describe the newest React and React Native concepts that are coming to the framework, especially from the web world.

### Summary
Thanks for reading this blog post and I hope you will like the blog posts that I'll be publishing here in the nearest future!
